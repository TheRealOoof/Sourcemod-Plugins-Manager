# Sourcemod Plugins Manager
A sourcemod plugins manager to help disable/enable plugins with chat commands. This has been manually 
coded to allow for easy management on my own private server. This sourcemod plugin uses 
extensive use of the sourcemod chat sommand "sm_say". No other includes are needed to compile this.

## Warning
Use this at your own risk, but I guarantee you can probably write this on your own. 
This has been coded just as a solution for a problem I was having. The code is extremely simple.

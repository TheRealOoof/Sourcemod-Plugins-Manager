# Sourcemod Plugins Manager
A sourcemod plugins manager to help disable/enable plugins with chat commands. The benefit of using this over the in-plugin cvars is that this makes sure that only one plugin is allowed to be enabled at once. This sourcemod plugin uses 
extensive use of the sourcemod chat command "sm_say". No other includes are needed to compile this.

## Warning
Use this at your own risk, but I guarantee you can probably write this on your own. 
This has been coded just as a solution for a problem I was having. The code is extremely simple.

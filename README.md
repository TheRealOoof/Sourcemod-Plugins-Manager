# Sourcemod-Plugins-Manager
A sourcemod plugins manager to help disable/enable plugins with chat commands. This has been manually coded to allow for easy management on my own private server.

This sourcemod plugin uses extensive use of the sourcemod chat sommand "sm_say". No other includes are needed to compile this.

Use this at your own risk, but I guarantee you can probably write this on your own.
